# Single Mass Oscillator

![](smo_fig.png)

This little python program provides a numerical time integration of Newmarks method, to obtain a solution to the differential equation of a single mass oscillator.

The scalar differential equation is given with:

$$\ddot{x} \, m + \dot{x} \, d+ x k = f^{ext}$$
